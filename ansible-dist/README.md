# Don't use this -- example only

This is a copy of https://github.com/ansible/ansible made on 2012-07-14. It contains
a single change on line 33 of lib/ansible/runner/connection__init__.py which comments out loading paramiko_ssh for local connections.

I've also removed the directories:

	test/
	examples/
	docs/
